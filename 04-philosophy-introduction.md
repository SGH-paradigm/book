# Philosophy Introduction

This section explores the philosophical foundations of the SGH framework. It investigates:

- The nature of knowledge and existence
- The hierarchy and unification of concepts
- The meaning of dimensionality beyond physical space
- The interdependence of logic, perception, and scientific abstraction

Each chapter reflects on a dimension of human thought that contributes to our scientific worldview. We aim to bridge the gap between abstract metaphysics and concrete physics by treating philosophy as an active methodology rather than passive reflection.

From ontology to epistemology, each idea builds toward the need for generalizationâ€”not as simplification, but as synthesis.

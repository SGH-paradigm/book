# Philosophy Preface

Philosophy forms the foundation of all scientific thought. It asks the essential "why" before science answers the "how." In this section, we return to the roots of inquiry to frame the epistemological and metaphysical assumptions underlying the Science Generalization Hypothesis (SGH).

The role of philosophy here is not merely historical; it is active, dynamic, and interwoven with the scientific method. It is the compass that aligns our pursuit of truth across diverse domains.

The chapters that follow attempt to reformulate ancient and modern philosophical ideas through the lens of unification, preparing the intellectual ground for the mathematical and physical formulations that follow.
